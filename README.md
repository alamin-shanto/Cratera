# Cratera

This is a subscription based service. Where you can easily browse, subscribe to and manage monthly subscription boxes based on your preferences.  

 I used these tools to make this web app :

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) used to create my web app.
- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) used for routing in my web app.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) used for authenticate my Web App.
- [Lucide-icons](https://lucide.dev/) used in the Web App for all the Icons.
- [IMGBB](https://imgbb.com/) used for hosting all images used in the Web App.
- [Surge](https://surge.sh/) used for hosting the Web App.
- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) used for Copywrite free images that were used in the web app.

## Customer satisfaction at its best

 Each box is curated with items tailored to the userâ€™s interests, ensuring that they receive something new and exciting each month.
